This directory contains files to be installed in the ${prefix}/share
directory (e.g. /usr/share or /usr/local/share) on Linux, or in the
installation directory (e.g.  C:/Program Files (x86)/Sequencer64/data) on
Windows.

The files include alternate configuration files that the user can copy to
$HOME/.config/sequencer64 and modify to satisfaction, and sample
Sequencer64 MIDI files.
