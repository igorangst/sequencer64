2015-09-10 to 2018-06-02

Sequencer64 is a reboot of seq24, extending it with new features and bug fixes.
The heart of seq24 remains intact.  It is an old friend, and maintains some
backward-compatibility with the --legacy option.  An extensive manual is
found at https://github.com/ahlstromcj/sequencer64-doc.git.  Prebuilt Debian
packages, source tarballs, and Windows installers are available:

    https://github.com/ahlstromcj/sequencer64-packages.git.

Sequencer64 has quite a few builds providing support for ALSA, PortMidi, JACK,
and Gtkmm 2.4, Qt 5, and command-line user-interfaces.

Native JACK support: Seq64rtmidi/seq64

    Sequencer64 has native JACK MIDI and Transport, with virtual/manual ports
    and auto-connect like ALSA, based on RtMidi massively refactored. It falls
    back to ALSA support if JACK is not running.  See README.jack for basic
    instructions on native JACK.

GUI-less native JACK support: Seq64rtmidi/seq64cli

    The JACK version without a GUI.  Currently controlled via MIDI control
    events (start/stop events must be set up), it relies on a good working
    configuration generated via the GUI or edited by hand.  Currently the only
    way to load a MIDI file is as the last argument on the command line.  We
    hope to add an OSC harness eventually.  It supports a "daemonize" option
    and dumping status to a log-file in the user-configuration directory.

Windows support (derived from PortMidi):

    This version uses a Qt 5 user-interface based on Kepler34, but using the
    standard Sequencer64 libraries.  The user-interface works, and Windows
    built-in MIDI devices are detected, inaccessible devices are ignored, and
    playback (e.g. to the built-in wavetable synthesizer) work. It can be
    built easily via Qt Creator or qmake.

    The Qt 5 GUI is well behind the Gtkmm 2.4 GUI for many features.
    That will be fixed bit-by-bit (help wanted!).  In the meantime,
    some configuration can be done manually in the "rc" and "usr" files.
    See README.windows for more information.

See the INSTALL file for build-from-source instructions or using a
conventional source tarball.

Recent changes:

    -   Version 0.95.0:
        -   Improved the Windows version and its packaging.  Added a Windows
            icon, an installer, better data support and documentation, and
            upgrades to the GUI.
        -   Added the ability to ignore ports that cannot be opened, and to
            report them.  Needed for Windows.
        -   Fixed display of event data values in the Gtkmm GUI.
        -   Fixed broken "replace loop" recording functionality (Linux).
        -   Fixed broken "expand loop" recording functionality (Linux).
        -   As usual, a raft of minor improvements.
    -   Version 0.94.8:
        -   Fixed issues with configure.ac.
        -   Added Qt "pro" files to support qmake and Qt Creator to make
            a PortMidi build for Linux/Windows.
        -   Added full-path handling to recent-files feature and fixed issues
            with it.
        -   Improved the log-file handling and added it to all versions of the
            application.  Added reroute_stdio() implementation for Windows.
        -   Caught up with the latest features for 32-bit builds, more to do.
        -   Beefing up PortMidi error-handling.
    -   Version 0.94.7:
        -   Keystroke-handling cleanup in preparation for a Qt build.
            Qt keystroke combinations now mapped to Gtkmm values. Tricky.
        -   Now storing the full path-names of recent-file entries.
        -   Restored mainwid event color to the normal colors if no
            color palette selection for the sequence.
        -   Fixed a bug in reading long recent-file entries.  Caused an
            infinite loop.  Your basic programmer brain-fart.  Also fixed
            recent-file handling in Gtkmm and Qt builds.
        -   Improve the handling of "-o scale=x.y", still has minor issues.
        -   The basics of the Qt build work.  It uses the internals from
            seq64, but the Qt user-interface still lacks a lot of features of
            seq64.
    -   For earlier version information, see the NEWS and ChangeLog files.

This package is oriented to developers and users who do not mind building from
source, with a little help.  It is fairly well organized and well documented.
Please see the INSTALL file for a brief description of installation.

Initial work/thought/documentation started in July of 2015, when I was laid
up after some old-man surgery.

See the ROADMAP file for more information and a kind of TODO list.  Also see
contrib/notes/bugs_to_investigate.  Sequencer64 is documented by the following
project, a 190+-page PDF file and its LaTeX source code:
